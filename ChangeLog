version 0.79  Chris O'Brien  <siege@preoccupied.net>
	2004-06-16: Patches from nosnilmot to sync up with changes to
	Gaim CVS, and to add some options to the configure script

	* mwgaim.c: mw_list_status_text had a C99-ism that needed to
	be removed. mw_add_buddy, mw_add_buddies, mw_remove_buddy, and
	mw_remove_buddies added GaimGroup params

	* mwgaim.h: pretty unnecessary, so removed.

	2004-05-17: Separated meanwhile-gaim from meanwhile
