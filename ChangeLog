version 1.2.1 (cvs)

	- building against meanwhile 0.4.1

	- removed username split for Server, moving it back to an account
	setting. This should fix log location the way it was pre-1.2.0
	
	- support for sending/receiving files over the File Transfer
	service
	
	- added "Supports" section to tooltip text for buddies, displaying
	A/V and File Transfer capabilities
	
	- fix #1185763 gaim-meanwhile 1.2.0 not showing Notesbuddy
	messages

	- added context menu item for NAB groups
	
	- differentiate between read-callback disconnect codes
	
	- support for adding, loading, saving Notes Address Book groups
	
	- quiet down error messages when the other end of a conversation
	logs off. Only display when there are still unsent messages in the
	conversation queue
	
	- added support for sending the LoginCont message when the server
	issues a LoginRedirect if the redirect connect fails

	- added a plugin option to always LoginCont and never attempt a
	redirected login
	
	- fixed a problem with moving buddies between groups that would
	cause the change not to be saved.

	- changed the active/away/busy messages dialog to only allow
	single-line messages, to prevent problems when the messages are
	saved to the storage service (and possibly loaded by another
	client, which doesn't permit multi-line messages). Custom away
	messages may still be multi-line

	- Get Info for buddies in the blist is functional

version 0.80  Chris O'Brien  <siege@preoccupied.net>

	2004-07-18: Essentially the same as 0.79-1 with some minor changes
	to the preferences to make use of the new INFO preference to
	display the use warning. Still for use against Meanwhile 0.3
	
version 0.79  Chris O'Brien  <siege@preoccupied.net>

	2004-06-26: Fixed a crash bug, and added the ability to store
	buddy lists back on the server.
	
	2004-06-23: The server-side buddy list is now imported on
	login. Had to work around an apparent bug in the mw_add_buddy
	call, in that the GaimGroup param was sometimes NULL. This caused
	much consternation.
	
	2004-06-21: Changes to work with evolving Meanwhile API. Gaim is
	in string-freeze for a 0.79 release targeted for the 24th.

	* mwgaim.c: prpl_info structure includes new icon spec field
	
	2004-06-16: Patches from nosnilmot to sync up with changes to Gaim
	CVS, and to add some options to the configure script

	* mwgaim.c: mw_list_status_text had a C99-ism that needed to be
	removed. mw_add_buddy, mw_add_buddies, mw_remove_buddy, and
	mw_remove_buddies added GaimGroup params

	* mwgaim.h: pretty unnecessary, so removed.

	2004-05-17: Separated meanwhile-gaim from meanwhile
	libraries. Versioning of meanwhile-gaim will continue to match
	Gaim releases. First release using autoconf and automake.
