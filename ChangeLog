version 1.2.1 (cvs)

	- fixed a problem with moving buddies between groups that would
	cause the change not to be saved.

	- changed the active/away/busy messages dialog to only allow
	single-line messages, to prevent problems when the messages are
	saved to the storage service (and possibly loaded by another
	client, which doesn't permit multi-line messages). Custom away
	messages may still be multi-line
	
version 1.2.0 (2005-03-18)

        - building against meanwhile 0.4.0

	- building against gaim 1.2.0

	- associate known client type identifier with buddies and display
	in tooltip information

	- perform resolve lookup on single-buddy additions to ensure they
	really exist, and to prompt user if multiple matches exist
	
	- slightly better handling of server_alias data from loading of
	buddy list from server

	- patch #1076834 Away/available state and debug logging

	- 'psychic mode' feature, to open an IM window when someone opens
	an IM to you (before they send a message)

version 0.80  Chris O'Brien  <siege@preoccupied.net>

	2004-07-18: Essentially the same as 0.79-1 with some minor changes
	to the preferences to make use of the new INFO preference to
	display the use warning. Still for use against Meanwhile 0.3
	
version 0.79  Chris O'Brien  <siege@preoccupied.net>

	2004-06-26: Fixed a crash bug, and added the ability to store
	buddy lists back on the server.
	
	2004-06-23: The server-side buddy list is now imported on
	login. Had to work around an apparent bug in the mw_add_buddy
	call, in that the GaimGroup param was sometimes NULL. This caused
	much consternation.
	
	2004-06-21: Changes to work with evolving Meanwhile API. Gaim is
	in string-freeze for a 0.79 release targeted for the 24th.

	* mwgaim.c: prpl_info structure includes new icon spec field
	
	2004-06-16: Patches from nosnilmot to sync up with changes to Gaim
	CVS, and to add some options to the configure script

	* mwgaim.c: mw_list_status_text had a C99-ism that needed to be
	removed. mw_add_buddy, mw_add_buddies, mw_remove_buddy, and
	mw_remove_buddies added GaimGroup params

	* mwgaim.h: pretty unnecessary, so removed.
	
version 0.78  Chris O'Brien  <siege@preoccupied.net>
	
	2004-06-01: First import into sf.net CVS
	
	2004-05-17: Separated meanwhile-gaim from meanwhile
	libraries. Versioning of meanwhile-gaim will continue to match
	Gaim releases. First release using autoconf and automake.
