version 0.80  Chris O'Brien  <siege@preoccupied.net>

	2004-07-18: Essentially the same as 0.79-1 with some minor changes
	to the preferences to make use of the new INFO preference to
	display the use warning. Still for use against Meanwhile 0.3
	
version 0.79  Chris O'Brien  <siege@preoccupied.net>

	2004-06-26: Fixed a crash bug, and added the ability to store
	buddy lists back on the server.
	
	2004-06-23: The server-side buddy list is now imported on
	login. Had to work around an apparent bug in the mw_add_buddy
	call, in that the GaimGroup param was sometimes NULL. This caused
	much consternation.
	
	2004-06-21: Changes to work with evolving Meanwhile API. Gaim is
	in string-freeze for a 0.79 release targeted for the 24th.

	* mwgaim.c: prpl_info structure includes new icon spec field
	
	2004-06-16: Patches from nosnilmot to sync up with changes to Gaim
	CVS, and to add some options to the configure script

	* mwgaim.c: mw_list_status_text had a C99-ism that needed to be
	removed. mw_add_buddy, mw_add_buddies, mw_remove_buddy, and
	mw_remove_buddies added GaimGroup params

	* mwgaim.h: pretty unnecessary, so removed.

	2004-06-01: First import into sf.net CVS
	
	2004-05-17: Separated meanwhile-gaim from meanwhile

	Gaim releases. First release using autoconf and automake.
