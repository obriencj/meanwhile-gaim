Since there is currently no proper gaim-devel package, and since we of course
require certain gaim headers in our build process, the gaim source code needs
to be available for this package to be built.

The location of this package is not hard-coded anywhere. Instead, the user
building the plugin should specifiy the path to the gaim src directory through
the configure option as follows:

	./configure --with-gaim-source=/path/to/gaim/src 

This will generate the necessary Makefiles. Then just run:

	make
	su -c "make install"

And eveything should be fine.
