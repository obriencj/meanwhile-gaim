Assuming you've built Gaim from source:

	./autogen.sh && make all
	su -c "make install"

and eveything should be fine. If Gaim is installed from an RPM, then:

	./autogen.sh && make dist
	su -c "rpmbuild -tb gaim-meanwhile-*.tar.gz"

should create binary RPMs. Installing those should get Meanwhile working.
