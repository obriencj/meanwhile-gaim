Assuming you've built Gaim from source:

	./autogen.sh
	PKG_CONFIG_PATH=/usr/local/include ./configure
	make all
	su -c "make install"

and eveything should be fine. If Gaim is installed from an RPM, then:

	./autogen.sh && ./configure
	make dist
	su -c "rpmbuild -tb gaim-meanwhile-0.81.tar.gz"

should create binary RPMs. Installing those should get Meanwhile working.
