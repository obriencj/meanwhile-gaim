I am the very model of a modern meanwhile module
My development done in emacs, gcc, and terminal.
With Gaim hacks to do user lookups, some of them quite terrible.
And File Transfer, oh my god, that code is diabolical.
Dynamic groups were something else, and that's not hypothetical,
But luckily I'd done that patch; supporting them is bearable.
With Lotus upper management I've formed the basis of a truce--
To Linux I will bring a sametime client that won't suck to use!
